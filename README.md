# national-highways
**data engineering** project that aims to de-congest the national highways by analyzing the road traffic data from different toll plazas.
Each highway is operated by a different toll operator with a different IT setup that uses different file formats 
my job is to collect data available in different formats and consolidate it into a single file.

using airflow  and pandas in this project I did this :
* Extracted data from a csv file
* Extracted data from a tsv file
* Extracted data from a fixed width file
* Transformed the data
* Loaded the transformed data into the staging area
